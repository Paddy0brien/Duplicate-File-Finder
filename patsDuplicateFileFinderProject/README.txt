This project finds all the duplicate files in a given directory and writes them to the terminal. 

How to compile and run:
1. Unzip the folder
2. Open command prompt and move to duplicateFileFinder folder
3. Run 'csc Program.cs' to compile into executable
4. Copy address as text of TestDirectory folder
5. Run Program.exe in command line and paste directory path when prompted

A file is assumed to be a duplicate if it has the same name and size of another file. A more thorough
method would compare the contents of the files but that will be quite performance taxing with large
files. Using a visual representation of the files and their location would also greatly improve the 
project as it would give users a clearer idea of where the duplications can be found.
